* Emux

=Emux= is a vanilla Emacs wrapper bundled with a minimal Elisp configuration. It
is designed to be a lightweight, highly responsive alternative to =tmux=.

** Core Philosophy

- *Self-Contained*: It starts Emacs using the script's directory as the
  ~init-dir~, keeping your environment portable and isolated.
- *Tmux Replacement*: While it works in GUI mode, it is intended to run
  primarily in any terminal (~-nw~).
- *Speed & Efficiency*: The config is inspired by *Doom Emacs*. It uses
  ~elpaca.el~ for package management; while the first run or package updates
  may take some time, subsequent boots typically take *less than 0.2 seconds*.
- *Persistent Sessions*: It operates by starting an Emacs server at a specific
  socket. You can run =emux= from multiple terminal tabs to connect to the same
  session, sharing buffers and state across your entire workspace.

It uses vterm by default, but you can use eat as well. Just configure the
emacs. Some tips: =SPC t t= gets you a vterm; it asks you to name it. =M-x
rename-buffer= is also handy.

** Installation

Run the provided ~install.sh~ within that directory:
#+begin_src bash
chmod +x install.sh ./install.sh
#+end_src
This will create a symbolic link named ~emux~ inside your ~$HOME/.local/bin~ directory.

** Usage & Tips

- *Launch/Attach*:
  #+begin_src bash
  PATH="$HOME"/.local/bin:"$PATH" emux
  #+end_src
- *Vterm*: By default, it is configured to use ~vterm~ (though you can use ~eat~ if you prefer).
- *Workflow*:
  - =SPC t t= :: Opens a new ~vterm~ buffer. The script will prompt you to give it a name.
  - =M-x rename-buffer= :: Highly recommended for keeping your various terminal
    sessions organized—much more flexible than tmux window names.

** Notes

- *First Run*: The initial launch will take longer as ~elpaca~ clones and builds
  your packages. Do not interrupt this process.
  
- *Killing the Server*: Since =emux= runs as a daemon, closing your terminal
  window won't kill the session. To shut down the server completely, use ~M-x
  kill-emacs~ inside the application.
- *Why vterm is better than eat for Emux*
  - Performance: Since vterm is built on a compiled C library, it processes
    massive data streams significantly faster than eat without freezing the
    Emacs UI.
  - Fidelity: It provides near-perfect terminal emulation for complex TUI
    applications like htop or vim, which occasionally suffer from rendering
    glitches in pure-Elisp alternatives.
  - Persistence: The C-based backend offers superior stability for
    long-running server sessions, ensuring your terminal buffers remain
    responsive even after weeks of uptime.
